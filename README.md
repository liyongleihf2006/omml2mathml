Small utility to convert from Microsoft's OMML to MathML.

This is by and large a port of the the `omml2mathml.xsl` XSLT that Microsoft ships with Office and
that is in relatively wide use, with a few bugs fixed. This implementation does not require an
XSLT processor (I built it because I became tired of XSLT processors that crash)

## Installation

    npm install omml2mathml

## API

The API is very simple: there is only one function to know, it takes one input, runs synchronously,
and returns one output.

```js
import omml2mathml from 'omml2mathml';
let mathmlElement = omml2mathml(oMathElement);
```

The input should be an `m:oMath` or `m:oMathPara` element. Note that you can always use the former
even if it has an `m:oMathPara` parent and the module will correctly set `display="block"` all the
same. The object does not need to belong to any specific DOM implementation, it just needs to
support some basic DOM operations (roughyl DOM 2, and then again not all of it). For instance
the `xmldom` module will work fine.

It returns an instance of a `math` element as an HTML DOM object, as produced through the
[`get-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-dom) module, which is to say that if you are running
this in the browser it will be the browser's implementation; if in Node it will be `jsdom`.
